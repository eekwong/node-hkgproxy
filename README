node-hkgproxy

This is a simple http proxy for submitting a batch requests to
forum[1-12].hkgolden.com for faster page loading.

hkgolden.com forum can be really slow (for overseas) and this project
is mainly for learning node.

This script is only working with node 0.5.4, tested with the windows node.exe
executable.

My Chrome proxy extension: Proxy Switchy!

Usage:
> node hkgproxy.js
> node hkgproxy.js <port>
